I've been feeling really off lately, and there are a few things that have been worrying me.

For starters, I'm always thirsty. No matter how much water I drink, I just can't seem to quench my thirst. It's gotten to the point where I'm drinking water constantly throughout the day and even waking up at night to drink more.

Along with that, I'm going to the bathroom much more frequently than usual. I'm also feeling extremely tired all the time, even though I'm getting enough sleep.

Iâ€™ve noticed my vision getting a bit blurry sometimes, and I've lost some weight without trying. Plus, I get these headaches and feel dizzy every now and then.

Overall, I just don't feel like myself and thought it was time to get checked out.
